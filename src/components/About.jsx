        Hi this is my first website I've put online and I wanted to keep it
        simple so there are no accounts or ways to delete your posts. If you do
        need something deleted just reach out to me. @gnnats on instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also post your zine files in order (you can click and drag to select
        multiple files).
      </p>
